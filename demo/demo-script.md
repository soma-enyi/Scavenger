## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Fails
- **Issue**: "Insufficient XLM balance"
- **Solution**: Fund account via friendbot again

### Wallet Not Connected
- **Issue**: "Please connect wallet"
- **Solution**: Ensure Freighter is unlocked and connected to testnet

### Contract Error
- **Issue**: "Participant not registered"
- **Solution**: Complete registration step first

### Transfer Fails
- **Issue**: "Not the current owner"
- **Solution**: Verify you're logged in with the correct account

## Demo Tips

1. **Preparation**: Pre-fund all demo accounts before starting
2. **Timing**: Allow 30 seconds between transactions for blockchain confirmation
3. **Visuals**: Keep the block explorer open to show real-time transactions
4. **Narrative**: Explain the circular economy concept as you demo
5. **Questions**: Pause after each major section for audience questions

## Advanced Demo Scenarios

### Scenario A: Multiple Waste Types
- Submit different waste types (Paper, Metal, Glass)
- Create incentives for each type
- Show filtering and sorting capabilities

### Scenario B: Batch Operations
- Submit multiple waste items at once
- Demonstrate bulk transfer capabilities
- Show aggregated statistics

### Scenario C: Supply Chain Tracking
- Follow a single waste item through multiple transfers
- Visualize the complete journey on the tracker
- Highlight transparency and traceability

## Demo Data Cleanup

After the demo, you can:
1. Keep the contract for future demos
2. Deploy a fresh contract for clean slate
3. Deactivate all test incentives
4. Document final state for reference

## Next Steps

After the demo, guide participants to:
1. Review the documentation
2. Explore the GitHub repository
3. Try the testnet deployment themselves
4. Provide feedback and suggestions
